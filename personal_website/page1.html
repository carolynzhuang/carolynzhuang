                The first time my friends and I cut a watermelon with a plastic knife was in AP Physics class. I had been given a watermelon but no means to cut it, so I found a plastic knife and we got to work. The watermelon was delicious, but I think our teacher was disappointed.

                We continued this tradition of cutting watermelon with plastic knives at my friend’s birthday party. It was a potluck, so I lugged a giant watermelon to her house. That watermelon was genuinely one of the best I’ve ever eaten.
