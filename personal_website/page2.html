                I was visiting a temple in Xiâ€™an, China, and it was super hot outside. Luckily, an old lady was selling cut watermelon at a stand for 10 RMB, so I bought myself a cup to cool down. It was so good!

                As I was leaving China, I passed a man driving around a cart full of watermelons. I really wanted to eat one but I had places to be :(
